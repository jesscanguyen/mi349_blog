                    <h2>hi! i'm jessica.</h2>
                    <p>welcome to what's basically my journal! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-</p>
                    <p>with this website, since it's a blog, i wanted it to be journaly/scrapbook theme with a warm feeling that conveys my personality. </p>
                    <p>currently, i am a senior at michigan state university studying information science concentrating in human-centered technologies, with a minor in graphic design!</p>
                    <p>growing up, i always had a love for psychology and design. with these core passions of mine, i love the opportunity ui/ux presents in combining them into outcomes that make a meaningful and memorable impact on people's lives.</p>
                    <p>currently, i am working at the MSU Libraries as a student employee for their accessibility unit! i ensure the online electronic resources are accessible using tools like screen readers, color contrast checkers, etc. in the past month, i just finished doing contract work for a student start-up called Notello as their ui/ux designer!</p>
